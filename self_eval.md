# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
    It's useful when you need to define a value of a varible that is not text or number based. Like a electrical circuit, open or closed, on or off!
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    Not sure there is anything I would change, but it was tedious at first jumping back and forth between VS Code and terminal to check my code. I'd maybe use Replit so I could see the results faster!
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    Realizing that I was thinking waaaay to hard about the medium coding challenge. I learned a valuable lesson, instead of staring at my code trying to guess whats gonna happen, don't be afriad to try things even if you think they won't work! I was stuck until I realized that I just need to change the variable value to see any changes and that my statement was correct.
